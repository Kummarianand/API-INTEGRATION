Developing a Responsive News API App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework involves creating a web-based application that fetches and displays news articles dynamically from a public API. The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing, user-friendly interface that works seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices while providing real-time news updates based on user queries.

Project Overview:
The News API app integrates the News API to retrieve news articles from various sources. The app consists of a search bar where users can type in keywords to search for specific news. The fetched data is dynamically displayed using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system to ensure a responsive and organized layout. The app includes modern design elements like shadows, hover effects, and a color gradient to enhance the user experience.
